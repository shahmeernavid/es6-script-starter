Starter code for scripts compiled from ES6.

### Usage

Compile ES6 source with `gulp compile:source`. Watch for changes with `gulp watch:source`. Sources compiled into `dist` directory. Run tests with `gulp run:tests`. Compile and watch for changes in tests files with `gulp compile:tests` and `gulp watch:tests`, respectively.
